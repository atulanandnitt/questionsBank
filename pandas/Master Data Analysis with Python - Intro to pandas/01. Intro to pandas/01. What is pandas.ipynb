    "### What is pandas?\n",
    "pandas is one of the most popular open source data exploration libraries currently available. It gives its users the power to explore, manipulate, query, aggregate, and visualize **tabular** data. Tabular meaning data that is two-dimensional with rows and columns; i.e. a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why pandas and not xyz?\n",
    "In this current age of data explosion, there are now many dozens of other tools that have many of the same capabilities as the pandas library. However, there are many aspects of pandas that make it an attractive choice for data analysis and it continues to have one of the fastest growing user bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a Python library and integrates well with the other popular data science libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib and seaborn.\n",
    "* It is nearly self-contained in that lots of functionality is built into one package. This contrasts with R, where many packages are needed to obtain the same functionality.\n",
    "* The community is excellent. Looking at Stack Overflow, for example, there are [many ten's of thousands of][2] pandas questions. If you need help, you are nearly guaranteed to find it very quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it named after an East Asian bear?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library was begun by Wes McKinney beginning in 2008 at a hedge fund named AQR. Finance speak is to call tabular data 'panel data' which smashed together becomes pandas. If you are really interested in the history, you can hear it from the creator [himself][3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python already has data structures to handle data, why do we need another one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Python is a high-level language, its primary built-in data structures lists and dictionaries, do not easily lend themselves to tabular data analysis in ways that humans can operate on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### pandas is built directly on numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "[numpy][4] ('numerical Python') is the most popular third-party Python library for scientific computing and forms the foundation for dozens of others, including pandas. numpy's primary data structure is an n-dimensional array which is much more powerful than a Python list and with much better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data in pandas is stored in numpy arrays. That said, it isn't necessary to know much about numpy when learning pandas. You can think of pandas as a higher-level, easier to use interface for doing data analysis than numpy. It is a good idea to eventually learn numpy, but for most tasks, pandas will be the right tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### numpy tutorial in appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is not necessary to understand numpy to perform data analysis with pandas, it is a major piece of the data science ecosystem in Python and it can be used alongside pandas. A thorough numpy tutorial is available in Appendix A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## pandas operates on tabular (table) data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous formats for data such as XML, JSON, raw bytes, and many others. But, for our purposes, we will only be examining what most people think of when they think of data - a table. pandas is built just for analyzing this tabular, rectangular, very deceptively normal concept of data. pandas has the capability to read in many different formats of data, but they all will be converted to tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DataFrame and Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame and Series are the two primary pandas objects that we will be using throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DataFrame** - A two-dimensional data structure that looks like any other rectangular table of data you have seen with rows and columns.\n",
    "* **Series** - A single dimension of data. It is analogous to a single column of data or a one dimensional array.\n",

    "## pandas examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this chapter is dedicated to showing examples of what pandas is capable of doing. There will be one or two examples from each of the following major areas of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading data\n",
    "* Filtering data\n",
    "* Aggregating methods\n",
    "* Non-Aggregating methods\n",
    "* Aggregating within groups\n",
    "* Tidying data\n",
    "* Joining data\n",
    "* Time series analysis\n",
    "* Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to give you a broad overview of what pandas is capable of doing. You are not expected to understand the syntax but rather get a few ideas of what you can expect to accomplish when using pandas. Explanations will be brief, but hopefully will provide just enough information so that you can logically follow what the end result is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `head` method\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that many of the last lines of code end with the `head` method. This returns, by default, the first five rows. This helps keep the output compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading data\n",
    "There will be multiple datasets used during the rest of this chapter. pandas can read in a variety of different data formats. The `read_csv` function is able to read in text data that is separated by a delimiter. By default, the delimiter is a comma. Below, we read in public bike usage data from the city of Chicago."

For example sum, mean, median, min, and mix are all examples of aggregation functions. By default, calling these methods on a pandas DataFrame will apply the aggregation to each column.
