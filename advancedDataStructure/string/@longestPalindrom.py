"""
You have a client-server architecture. In between client 
and server you have your application. Given each server has a success probability factor `x`(0 to 1), You are supposed to come up with a logic so that you decide which server among all the active servers would process your request and give back the response to your application, which in turn is displayed to the user. Design and Develop your applicationâ€¦
